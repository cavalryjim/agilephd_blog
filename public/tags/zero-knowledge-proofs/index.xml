      <description>A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any additional information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This cryptographic technique is incredibly powerful and has various applications in the field of cybersecurity, blockchain, and privacy-preserving technologies.&#xA;The Essence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs To understand the concept, let&amp;rsquo;s break it down into three fundamental properties that a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy:</description>
