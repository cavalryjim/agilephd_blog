      <description>Why we do it this way.&#xA;Hash: a quick review If needed, I would encourage you to review my earlier post on hashing. Long story -&amp;gt; short, a hash is a short &amp;amp; unique representation of data. Using SHA256 and the hashlib.sha256() function, any data can be represented with a unique 32-byte hash value.&#xA;In Blockchain, each block will contain the hash of the previous block and the hash signature for it&amp;rsquo;s own data.</description>

      <description>This post will discuss the concept of hashing and provide examples using the Python programming language.&#xA;The Hash A hash refers to a mathematical function that takes some type of information as input and returns an encrypted output with a fixed length. This output, or hash, is unique to the information used as the input. You can think of it as being like a fingerprint.&#xA;SHA256 is a popular cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value.</description>

      <description>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. That said, let’s first review what is a “ledger”. In accounting, a ledger is an on-going list of bookkeeping records. A written ledger is maintained using a bound book with transactions recorded as a line on the page. This is very similar to the small “check register” booklets that would come with a new box of personal checks. Before online banking, checking account owners would record the check number, recipient, and amount when writing a check.</description>
