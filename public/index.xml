      <title>Elastic Beanstalk Healthcheck with a Django App</title>

      <description>The Problem Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is an orchestration service offered by AWS for deploying web applications. The good thing about EB is that it handles much of the setup for you. The bad thing is that EB also includes services, such as Healthchecks, that do not work for a Django app without additional setup.&#xA;Although my app was deployed and appeared to be working correctly, the Elastic Beanstalk environment reported Severe/Degraded state.</description>

      <description>Why we do it this way.&#xA;Hash: a quick review If needed, I would encourage you to review my earlier post on hashing. Long story -&amp;gt; short, a hash is a short &amp;amp; unique representation of data. Using SHA256 and the hashlib.sha256() function, any data can be represented with a unique 32-byte hash value.&#xA;In Blockchain, each block will contain the hash of the previous block and the hash signature for it&amp;rsquo;s own data.</description>

      <description>RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Cryptography RSA cryptography, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is a fundamental tool in modern cryptography and is used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. RSA relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers for its security.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified explanation of how RSA cryptography works:&#xA;Key Generation: The first step is to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.</description>

      <description>This post will discuss the concept of hashing and provide examples using the Python programming language.&#xA;The Hash A hash refers to a mathematical function that takes some type of information as input and returns an encrypted output with a fixed length. This output, or hash, is unique to the information used as the input. You can think of it as being like a fingerprint.&#xA;SHA256 is a popular cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value.</description>

      <description>Oﬃce of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology&#xA;Blockchain technology, widely known for its applications in cryptocurrency, is experiencing a paradigm shift, moving beyond financial transactions to personal and social applications. This transition is particularly evident in the healthcare sector, where blockchain&amp;rsquo;s potential to transform health data management is gaining traction.&#xA;Health Data Accessibility and Security One of the primary applications of Blockchain in healthcare is enhancing access to personal health data.</description>

      <description>If you are not a mixed maritial arts (MMA) fan, you might not recognize the photo above. Royce Gracie, a man of relatively slender stature and weighing a modest 170 lbs, won the first two Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) tourniments. In the early days of the UFC, there were no weight divisions and Royce Gracie routinely competed againt opponents that were 40 lbs or more larger than him.&#xA;How was he able to defeat these larger competitors?</description>

      <title>What is Blockchain?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/what_is_blockchain/</link>

      <description>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. That said, let’s first review what is a “ledger”. In accounting, a ledger is an on-going list of bookkeeping records. A written ledger is maintained using a bound book with transactions recorded as a line on the page. This is very similar to the small “check register” booklets that would come with a new box of personal checks. Before online banking, checking account owners would record the check number, recipient, and amount when writing a check.</description>

      <description>Working with dates &amp;amp; times can be frustrating. Many systems that you may encounter require various formatting for the datetime object. Luckily, Python is really good at handling this.&#xA;Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!&#xA;datetime Python has a module called datetime for working with date and time objects.&#xA;import datetime now = datetime.datetime.now() print(type(now)) print(&amp;#34;Current datetime = &amp;#34;, now) today = datetime.datetime.now().date() print(type(today)) print(&amp;#34;Current date = &amp;#34;, today) current_time = datetime.</description>

      <description>It took me seventeen years to get three thousand hits in baseball. I did it in one afternoon on the golf course.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Hank Aaron&#xA;eBay Find I’m a sucker for classic Ping clubs and found these ISIs on eBay. Most interesting to me was that the clubs were:&#xA;beryllium copper and appeared to be in great shape. Beryllium copper (BeCu) became popular back in the mid/late &amp;rsquo;80s principally because it was advertised as offering a softer feel than many of the equivalent cast steel designs of the time.</description>

      <description>In many situations, we will need to work with larger sets of data. Python easily allows for reading from and writing to files.&#xA;The open() method returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: open(filename, mode).&#xA;The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be &#39;r&#39; when the file will only be read, &#39;w&#39; for only writing, and &#39;a&#39; opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.</description>

      <description>A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.&#xA;Dictionary structure A dictionary, or dict, organizes data values by association with other data values rather than by sequential position. A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values. Dictionaries are initialized using curly braces { }.&#xA;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals = {&amp;#39;United States&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Washington, DC&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;France&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Paris&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Rome&amp;#39;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals {&amp;#39;United States&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Washington, DC&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;France&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Paris&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Rome&amp;#39;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; type(capitals) &amp;lt;class &amp;#39;dict&amp;#39;&amp;gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals[&amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39;] &amp;#39;Rome&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals[&amp;#39;Spain&amp;#39;] = &amp;#39;Madrid&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals {&amp;#39;United States&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Washington, DC&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;France&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Paris&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Rome&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Spain&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Madrid&amp;#39;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39;Germany&amp;#39; in capitals False &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; &amp;#39;Italy&amp;#39; in capitals True &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; morecapitals = {&amp;#39;Germany&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;Berlin&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;United Kingdom&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;London&amp;#39;} &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; capitals.</description>

      <description>In Python, a list is a sequence of data values called items or elements. An item can be of any type.&#xA;A Python list is similar to a list you would make in the real-world:&#xA;shopping list to-do list roster for a team guest list for a party List structure The logical structure of a list resembles the structure of a string. Items in a list are ordered by position. Each list item has a unique index specifying its position.</description>

      <description>In agile software development frameworks, such as Scrum, development is conducted in time-boxed work iterations called Sprints. Sprint Zero is all the work that needs to happen before you can start actually development1.&#xA;Python versions Technology is constantly changing. That the great thing about our industry and the frustrating thing about our industry. In Python, there was a bit of a riff when the language went from version 2.x to 3.</description>

      <description>Reprint from SiliconBayouNews&#xA;Occasionally, something comes along that causes a shift in the way we do things. In the sport of mixed martial arts, that shift came with the introduction of a fighting technique known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At its core, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on the fact that the majority of fights take place on the ground. Royce Gracie, a man of relatively small size, gained fame for his ability to defeat much larger opponents through the use of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</description>
