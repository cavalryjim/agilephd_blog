      <description>This is updated code from an earlier post about Langchain.&#xA;The code is being updated for three main reasons:&#xA;Some Windows users were having issues using Chroma for a vectorstore. I wanted to pass arguments to the script. The script needed more structure. Vectorstore In the earlier version, I used Chroma for storing the vectors. I liked this solution because it was easy and stored the results in a SQLite database.</description>

      <description>Primarily developed in Python, LangChain is a robust framework designed to simplify the development of applications that utilize large language models (LLMs). It enables developers to connect these models with various data sources and external APIs, facilitating the integration of advanced natural language processing capabilities into their applications. LangChain provides tools for constructing LLM-powered workflows, handling memory and state management, and ensuring scalability and efficiency. By offering a streamlined interface for working with LLMs, LangChain empowers developers to create sophisticated AI-driven solutions in areas such as chatbots, data analysis, content generation, and more, without needing extensive expertise in machine learning or AI model development.</description>

      <description>The Problem Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is an orchestration service offered by AWS for deploying web applications. The good thing about EB is that it handles much of the setup for you. The bad thing is that EB also includes services, such as Healthchecks, that do not work for a Django app without additional setup.&#xA;Although my app was deployed and appeared to be working correctly, the Elastic Beanstalk environment reported Severe/Degraded state.</description>

      <description>Why we do it this way.&#xA;Hash: a quick review If needed, I would encourage you to review my earlier post on hashing. Long story -&amp;gt; short, a hash is a short &amp;amp; unique representation of data. Using SHA256 and the hashlib.sha256() function, any data can be represented with a unique 32-byte hash value.&#xA;In Blockchain, each block will contain the hash of the previous block and the hash signature for it&amp;rsquo;s own data.</description>

      <description>RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Cryptography RSA cryptography, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is a fundamental tool in modern cryptography and is used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. RSA relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers for its security.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified explanation of how RSA cryptography works:&#xA;Key Generation: The first step is to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.</description>

      <description>This post will discuss the concept of hashing and provide examples using the Python programming language.&#xA;The Hash A hash refers to a mathematical function that takes some type of information as input and returns an encrypted output with a fixed length. This output, or hash, is unique to the information used as the input. You can think of it as being like a fingerprint.&#xA;SHA256 is a popular cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value.</description>

      <description>In blockchain technology, consensus algorithms are crucial for ensuring all participants in a network agree on the shared ledger&amp;rsquo;s state. Here are some of the most common consensus algorithms:&#xA;Proof of Work (PoW) Used by: Bitcoin, Ethereum (until it moved to PoS). Mechanism: Miners solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and create new blocks. The first to solve the problem gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.</description>

      <description>The Ethereum Merge was a monumental event in the blockchain world, transforming the Ethereum network from a Proof of Work (PoW) to a Proof of Stake (PoS) system. Full disclosure: I followed the &amp;ldquo;Merge&amp;rdquo; as an academic, investor, and Ethereum miner. Because of financial reasons, I did not particularly want it to happen but the transition was both significant and impactful and deserve reflection.&#xA;What Was the Ethereum Merge? The Ethereum Merge marked the transition from PoW, where miners like us solved complex puzzles to validate transactions, to PoS, where validators staked Ether (ETH) to propose and validate new blocks.</description>

      <description>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. That said, let’s first review what is a “ledger”. In accounting, a ledger is an on-going list of bookkeeping records. A written ledger is maintained using a bound book with transactions recorded as a line on the page. This is very similar to the small “check register” booklets that would come with a new box of personal checks. Before online banking, checking account owners would record the check number, recipient, and amount when writing a check.</description>

      <description>Web scraping is the automated process of extracting data from one, or more, websites. Automation allows for the collection and analysis of large volumes of web-based information efficiently. Utilizing tools and programming languages such as Python, web scraping involves sending requests to websites, parsing the HTML content, and retrieving specific data points like text, images, or links. This technique is widely used in various fields, including data analysis, market research, and content aggregation, allowing businesses and individuals to gather valuable insights and make informed decisions based on real-time web data.</description>

With accusations such as the Chaos Report, the field of IT project management was under attack and innovative approaches were emerging from industry.1 One of the main instigations causing new development approaches was the requirement of substantial upfront planning and the inability of traditional methods to handle frequent changes.</description>

      <description>A version of the code for this iteration of Tweeter can be viewed on GitHub.&#xA;Django REST Framework comes with several built-in authentication solutions. Most APIs will use one of these authentication types:&#xA;BasicAuthentication: each request is authenticated with a username and password. Basic authentication is inefficient and generally not used with production APIs. TokenAuthentication: users are assigned a complex token that is added to the header of each request.</description>

Although we might not mind anonymous viewing, anyone can create, edit, update, or delete a tweet.&#xA;As an example, the tweet detail page http://localhost:8000/api/v1/tweets/1/ displays the tweet information, which is fine, except any random user, anonymous or otherwise, can update or delete an existing tweet.</description>

      <description>Django and the Django REST Framework are a popular combination for building and maintaining robust Web APIs. The term API is a bit dated and stands for Application Program Interface. The important word is &amp;ldquo;Interface&amp;rdquo; in that the ability to communicate with other applications gives our web app value.&#xA;A version of this code can be found on GitHub.&#xA;HTTP The HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) protocol provides the structure for communicating files across the Internet.</description>

      <description>In many situations, we will need to work with larger sets of data. Python easily allows for reading from and writing to files.&#xA;The open() method returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: open(filename, mode).&#xA;The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. mode can be &#39;r&#39; when the file will only be read, &#39;w&#39; for only writing, and &#39;a&#39; opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.</description>

In the sport of mixed martial arts, that shift came with the introduction of a fighting technique known as Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. At its core, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on the fact that the majority of fights take place on the ground. Royce Gracie, a man of relatively small size, gained fame for his ability to defeat much larger opponents through the use of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</description>
