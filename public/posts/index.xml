      <title>Elastic Beanstalk Healthcheck with a Django App</title>

      <description>The Problem Elastic Beanstalk (EB) is an orchestration service offered by AWS for deploying web applications. The good thing about EB is that it handles much of the setup for you. The bad thing is that EB also includes services, such as Healthchecks, that do not work for a Django app without additional setup.&#xA;Although my app was deployed and appeared to be working correctly, the Elastic Beanstalk environment reported Severe/Degraded state.</description>

      <title>Nonce and the Hash</title>

      <description>Why we do it this way.&#xA;Hash: a quick review If needed, I would encourage you to review my earlier post on hashing. Long story -&amp;gt; short, a hash is a short &amp;amp; unique representation of data. Using SHA256 and the hashlib.sha256() function, any data can be represented with a unique 32-byte hash value.&#xA;In Blockchain, each block will contain the hash of the previous block and the hash signature for it&amp;rsquo;s own data.</description>

      <description>RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) Cryptography RSA cryptography, named after its inventors Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, is a widely used asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is a fundamental tool in modern cryptography and is used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and various other cryptographic applications. RSA relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers for its security.&#xA;Here&amp;rsquo;s a simplified explanation of how RSA cryptography works:&#xA;Key Generation: The first step is to generate a pair of keys: a public key and a private key.</description>

      <title>Hashing</title>

      <description>This post will discuss the concept of hashing and provide examples using the Python programming language.&#xA;The Hash A hash refers to a mathematical function that takes some type of information as input and returns an encrypted output with a fixed length. This output, or hash, is unique to the information used as the input. You can think of it as being like a fingerprint.&#xA;SHA256 is a popular cryptographic hash algorithm that produces a 256-bit hash value.</description>

      <title>What is Blockchain?</title>

      <description>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology. That said, let’s first review what is a “ledger”. In accounting, a ledger is an on-going list of bookkeeping records. A written ledger is maintained using a bound book with transactions recorded as a line on the page. This is very similar to the small “check register” booklets that would come with a new box of personal checks. Before online banking, checking account owners would record the check number, recipient, and amount when writing a check.</description>

      <description>It took me seventeen years to get three thousand hits in baseball. I did it in one afternoon on the golf course.&#xA;&amp;ndash; Hank Aaron&#xA;eBay Find I’m a sucker for classic Ping clubs and found these ISIs on eBay. Most interesting to me was that the clubs were:&#xA;beryllium copper and appeared to be in great shape. Beryllium copper (BeCu) became popular back in the mid/late &amp;rsquo;80s principally because it was advertised as offering a softer feel than many of the equivalent cast steel designs of the time.</description>
