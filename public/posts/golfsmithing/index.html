<h3 id="ebay">eBay</h3>
<p>I’m a sucker for classic Ping clubs and found these ISIs on eBay.  Most interesting to me was that the clubs were:</p>
<ol>
<li>beryllium copper and</li>
<li>appeared to be in great shape.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="../../golf_images/golf_8000.jpg" alt="eBay Clubs Head"></p>
<p>Beryllium copper (BeCu) became popular back in the mid/late &rsquo;80s principally because it was advertised as offering a softer feel than many of the equivalent cast steel designs of the time. A lot of people also liked the material as it took on a patina as it aged which was cosmetically attractive and very durable in that it &lsquo;healed&rsquo; any scratches or blemishes when it darkened. It was used by numerous manufacturers, perhaps most notably by Ping.</p>
<p>I submitted an offer and &lsquo;won&rsquo; the clubs for what I consider to be a great deal and started planning my weekend project.  The clubs arrived on a Friday along with another package from <a href="https://www.golfworks.com/">GolfWorks.com</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../golf_images/golf_8001.jpg" alt="eBay Clubs Grip"></p>
<p>For 20 year old clubs, they were in pristine condition and still had the 1998 price tags &amp; labels on the dry rotted grips. My plan was to re-grip the clubs, add 1/2” shaft extensions, and knock off the tarnish.</p>
<p><img src="../../golf_images/golf_8233.jpg" alt="Supplies"></p>
<p>In preparation for this project, I acquired some supplies.  Starting from the top left of the picture above, here are the items along with some uses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vinegar &amp; sea salt will be used for removing tarnish.</li>
<li>Mineral spirits are used for cleaning the club shafts and activating the grip tape.</li>
<li>Clap-on vise for holding the clubs.</li>
<li>Two-sided grip tape.</li>
<li>Blue masking tape.</li>
<li>Golf club epoxy.</li>
<li>For golfsmithing, I&rsquo;ve found a <a href="https://www.golfworks.com/the-golfworks-48-aluminum-golf-club-ruler/p/rul48/">long aluminum club ruler</a> works best but for this project, a tape measure will suffice.</li>
<li>Utility knife with hook blade.</li>
<li>Sharpie marker.</li>
<li>Pipe cutter.</li>
<li>Rubber shaft clamp to better stabalize and protect the club shaft in the vise.</li>
<li>Small funnel purchased from the Dollar Store after my wife found me rummaging throught the kitchen.</li>
<li>Scissors for cutting grip tape.</li>
<li>Scotch Brite pads (not shown).</li>
<li>Shop rags (not shown).</li>
<li>2-gallon bucket (not shown).</li>
</ul>
<p>The white folding table in the above picture was used throughout the project for staging the clubs &amp; supplies.  Not shown was a box full of new Ping grips and the shaft extensions purchased from GolfWorks along with some shop rags &amp; a 2-gallon bucket.</p>
<p><img src="../../golf_images/golf_8171.jpg" alt="Work Station"></p>
<p>This project was conducted at a vacation home on Mobile Bay.  Since there really isn&rsquo;t a good place to permently mount a vise, I assembled a temporary work station using a couple saw horses and some 2x6 boards.  The boards were acquired through pier damage from Hurricane Nate.  One of the boards was attached to another 2x6 in a &lsquo;T&rsquo;.  This worked well for me as it helped stabalize the psuedo-work bench and provided support when pushing on the new grips as it was backed against a piling under the house.</p>
<h3 id="remove-old-grips">Remove Old Grips</h3>
<p>Before removing the old grips, it is a good idea to square the clubface and mark the shaft for aligning the new grips.  I use masking tape for this.  Otherwise, your sharpie mark would likely be removed when cleaning the shaft with mineral spirits.</p>
