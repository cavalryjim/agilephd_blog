### eBay

I’m a sucker for classic Ping clubs and found these ISIs on eBay.  Most interesting to me was that the clubs were: 
1) beryllium copper and 
2) appeared to be in great shape.

Beryllium copper (BeCu) became popular back in the mid/late '80s principally because it was advertised as offering a softer feel than many of the equivalent cast steel designs of the time. A lot of people also liked the material as it took on a patina as it aged which was cosmetically attractive and very durable in that it 'healed' any scratches or blemishes when it darkened. It was used by numerous manufacturers, perhaps most notably by Ping.

I submitted an offer and 'won' the clubs for what I consider to be a great deal and started planning my weekend project.  The clubs arrived on a Friday along with another package from [GolfWorks.com](https://www.golfworks.com/).

For 20 year old clubs, they were in pristine condition and still had the 1998 price tags & labels on the dry rotted grips. My plan was to re-grip the clubs, add 1/2” shaft extensions, and knock off the tarnish.

In preparation for this project, I acquired some supplies.  Starting from the top left of the picture above, here are the items along with some uses:
- Vinegar & sea salt will be used for removing tarnish.
- Mineral spirits are used for cleaning the club shafts and activating the grip tape.
- Clap-on vise for holding the clubs.
- Two-sided grip tape.
- Blue masking tape.
- Golf club epoxy.
- For golfsmithing, I've found a [long aluminum club ruler](https://www.golfworks.com/the-golfworks-48-aluminum-golf-club-ruler/p/rul48/) works best but for this project, a tape measure will suffice.
- Utility knife with hook blade.
- Sharpie marker.
- Pipe cutter.
- Rubber shaft clamp to better stabalize and protect the club shaft in the vise.
- Small funnel purchased from the Dollar Store after my wife found me rummaging throught the kitchen.
- Scissors for cutting grip tape.
- Scotch Brite pads (not shown).
- Shop rags (not shown).
- 2-gallon bucket (not shown).

The white folding table in the above picture was used throughout the project for staging the clubs & supplies.  Not shown was a box full of new Ping grips and the shaft extensions purchased from GolfWorks along with some shop rags & a 2-gallon bucket.

This project was conducted at a vacation home on Mobile Bay.  Since there really isn't a good place to permently mount a vise, I assembled a temporary work station using a couple saw horses and some 2x6 boards.  The boards were acquired through pier damage from Hurricane Nate.  One of the boards was attached to another 2x6 in a 'T'.  This worked well for me as it helped stabalize the psuedo-work bench and provided support when pushing on the new grips as it was backed against a piling under the house.

### Remove Old Grips

Before removing the old grips, it is a good idea to square the clubface and mark the shaft for aligning the new grips.  I use masking tape for this.  Otherwise, your sharpie mark would likely be removed when cleaning the shaft with mineral spirits.
