Working with dates & times can be frustrating.  Many systems that you may encounter require various formatting for the datetime object.  Luckily, Python is really good at handling this.

### datetime

Python has a module called `datetime` for working with date and time objects.

```python
import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now()
print(type(now))
print("Current datetime = ", now)

today = datetime.datetime.now().date()
print(type(today))
print("Current date = ", today)

current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()
print(type(current_time))
print("Current time = ", current_time)
```

You can also create date and time objects by designating the date or time.

```python
import datetime

                # year, month, day
d = datetime.date(2018, 4, 13)
print(d)

                # hour, minute, second
t = datetime.time(9, 12, 22)
print(t)

                # year, month, day, hour, minute, second
dt = datetime.datetime(2018, 4, 13, 9, 12, 22)
print(dt)
```

We can also create date objects from a Unix timestamp. A Unix timestamp is the number of seconds since January 1, 1970 at UTC. You can convert a timestamp to date using `fromtimestamp()` method.

```python
from datetime import datetime

timestamp = datetime.fromtimestamp(1326244364)
print( "Date =", timestamp )
```

### strptime
There are times when you may receive the datetime object as a string.  No worries, Python has a robust package for turning a string into a Python datetime object.

The `strptime()` method takes two arguments:

- a string representing date and time
- format code for the first argument

```python
from datetime import datetime

date_string = "21 June, 2018"
print("date_string =", date_string)

date_object = datetime.strptime(date_string, "%d %B, %Y")
print("date_object =", date_object)
```

### strftime
Likewise, we can take the Python datetime object and turn it into a string.

```python
from datetime import datetime

# current date and time
now = datetime.now()

t = now.strftime("%H:%M:%S")
print("time:", t)

s1 = now.strftime("%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
# mm/dd/YY H:M:S format
print("s1:", s1)

s2 = now.strftime("%d/%b/%Y, %H:%M:%S")
# dd/MMM/YY H:M:S format
print("s2:", s2)
```

### relativedelta
Find the difference between two datetime or date objects.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

def main():
    birth_date = input('Enter your DOB as mm/dd/YYYY: ')
    print('your age is', age(birth_date))

def age(d):
    dob = datetime.strptime(d, '%m/%d/%Y')
    today = datetime.today()
    age = relativedelta(today, dob)
    return age.years

main()
```
