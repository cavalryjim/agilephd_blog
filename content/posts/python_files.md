![Files](../../files.png)

In many situations, we will need to work with larger sets of data.  Python easily allows for reading from and writing to files.

The `open()` method returns a file object, and is most commonly used with two arguments: **open(filename, mode)**.

The first argument is a string containing the filename. The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing the way in which the file will be used. *mode* can be ```'r'``` when the file will only be read, ```'w'``` for only writing, and ```'a'``` opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end. ```'r+'``` opens the file for both reading and writing.

### Reading from a file
As mentioned above to read a file, use the `open(filename, 'r')` method.  For reading a file, the mode argument is optional; ```'r'``` will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.

```python
file = open("text_file.txt")

for line in file:
    print(line)

file.close()
```

### Writing to a file
When opening a file using **open(filename, 'w')**, the returned file object can be used to write  information to the file but any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated.

```python
students = [ "Jennifer", "Craig", "Robert", "Boudreaux", "Thibodeaux"]
file = open("output_file.txt", "w")
file.write("Here is a list of names: \n")

for s in students:
    file.write(s + "\n")

file.close()
```


### Appending a file
Similar to writing to a file, you can also append new text to the already existing file instead of overwriting an existing file.

```python
more_students = ["Sonja", "Melissa", "Karen"]
file = open("output_file.txt", "a")
file.write("Here are some more names:\n")

for s in more_students:
    file.write(s + "\n")

file.close()
```

### The *with* statement
When finished working with a file, use the `close()` method to end the interaction with the file. This terminates the file object and makes the file available to other resources.

While it is a good programming habit to close files after use, we, as busy human beings, can sometimes forget to close a file after opening it.  

Luckily, Python has a `with` keyword that helps us better manage file resources. It is good practice to use `with` when using file objects. The advantage is that the file is properly closed after its code block has completed.


```python
with open("text_file.txt") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)

```

### JSON
With files, the **read()** and **write()** methods only use strings.  This can be problematic when trying to use files to store or share data that isn't easily converted to and from a string.  

Rather than having users constantly writing and debugging code to save complicated data types to files, Python allows you to use the popular data interchange format called **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**. The standard module called ```json``` can take Python data hierarchies, and convert them to string representations; this process is called serializing. Reconstructing the data from the string representation is called deserializing.

```python
import json

student_scores = {'name': 'John', 'scores': [90, 88, 92]}
with open("student_scores.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(student_scores, file)
```

```python
import json

with open("student_scores.json", "r") as file:
    student_scores = json.load(file)

print("The object type is: ", type(student_scores))
print(student_scores)
```

This simple serialization technique can handle lists and dictionaries, but serializing arbitrary class instances in JSON requires a bit of extra effort. The Python documents reference for the [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json) module contains an explanation of this.

JSON is the language of devices communicating over the Internet.  Roughly 80% of all existing APIs use JSON and it is very likely that over 95% of all new APIs are using JSON.  Anyone looking for a career in technology or data should be familiar with the producing and consuming JSON.

Here is an example of a JSON feed from an OpenData portal: [Baton Rouge Crime](https://data.brla.gov/resource/fabb-cnnu.json)


### Other file types
Data can be shared using multiple other file types, such as **.csv**, **.xls**, and **.xlsx** files.  To properly read these specifically formatted files, Python usually requires additional packages that can easily be added with the **import** command.  


```python
import csv

with open('mpg.csv') as file:
    mpg_reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in mpg_reader:
        print(row)
```
